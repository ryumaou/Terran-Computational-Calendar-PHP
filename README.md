# Terran-Computational-Calendar-PHP
A cleaned up version of the Terran Computational Calendar PHP library, with a demo PHP file to test the code and show the variables that are available.  

You can find out more about the Terran Computation Calendar at its homepage: https://terrancalendar.com/#Introduction
I merely cleaned up some extraneous characters in the PHP code that was downloaded from that site, injected by the Python script used to share it, I think, and added the demo file.  Put them in the same directory on your webserver and you should be good to test.
Enjoy and good luck!
